Our Journey
Cozy Library is the first project created by our team: Doresa, Edona, and Eriona. While it's not entirely perfect, it has been an incredibly educational experience. Working on Cozy Library has allowed us to delve into various aspects of web development, enhancing our skills significantly in a short time. We're proud of what we've accomplished and excited to continue improving and expanding our platform.
